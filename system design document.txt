## Introduction

### Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive overview of the system design for the chat-app, including its core and optional features, architecture, technologies, and best practices.

### Scope
This document covers the design and implementation details of the caht app, from user registration to real-time messaging and optional features like video/audio calling.

### Goals and Objectives
The primary goal of this messaging service app is to provide a secure, reliable, and user-friendly platform for communication, supporting individual and group chats with real-time updates.

### Components and Modules
Certainly, let's discuss the key components mentioned in your chat application, specifically the controllers, modules, routes, and utility files.

### Controllers:

1. **Auth Controller:**
   - **Purpose:** The Auth Controller is responsible for handling user authentication and authorization. It manages user registration, login, logout, token generation, and authentication middleware.
   - **Functions:** 
     - `registerUser`: Handles user registration.
     - `loginUser`: Manages user login.
     - `logoutUser`: Logs out the user.
     - `protect`: Middleware for protecting routes by checking authentication.
     - `restrictTo`: Middleware for authorizing specific roles.
   
2. **User Controller:**
   - **Purpose:** The User Controller deals with user-related operations such as managing user profiles, retrieving user information, and updating user details.
   - **Functions:**
     - `getUser`: Retrieves user information.
     - `updateUser`: Updates user details.
     - `deleteUser`: Deletes a user profile.

### Modules:

1. **Audio Call:**
   - **Purpose:** The Audio Call module likely handles the functionality related to one-to-one audio calls.
   - **Features:** 
     - Initiating audio calls.
     - Establishing audio connections.
     - Managing call duration and quality.
     - Ending calls.

2. **Video Call:**
   - **Purpose:** Similar to the Audio Call module, this module is responsible for managing one-to-one video calls.
   - **Features:** 
     - Initiating video calls.
     - Managing video streams.
     - Handling video call UI/UX.

3. **One-to-One Messaging:**
   - **Purpose:** This module is responsible for handling one-to-one text messaging between users.
   - **Features:** 
     - Sending and receiving text messages.
     - Real-time updates for new messages.
     - Message history and storage.

### Routes:

1. **Auth Routes (`auth.js`):**
   - These routes handle authentication-related endpoints, including user registration and login.
   - For example, `/api/v1/auth/register` and `/api/v1/auth/login`.

2. **Index Routes (`index.js`):**
   - The index routes may serve as a central routing point for various modules and sub-routes.
   - For example, `/api/v1/users` might route to user-related endpoints.

3. **User Routes (`user.js`):**
   - User routes are responsible for user-specific operations, such as retrieving user profiles and updating user information.
   - For example, `/api/v1/users/:id` for user profile details.

### Utility Files:

1. **AppError:**
   - **Purpose:** This utility file likely handles custom error messages and error handling throughout the application.
   - It may include functions for creating specific error instances and handling them consistently.

2. **Async:**
   - **Purpose:** The Async utility is likely used for handling asynchronous operations and promises, making it easier to manage async code flow.

3. **Mail:**
   - **Purpose:** The Mail utility may be responsible for sending emails, which can include features like sending OTPs for user verification, password reset links, and notifications.

These components work together to create a functional chat application with user authentication, messaging capabilities, and audio/video calling features. Each component plays a crucial role in ensuring the application's functionality and user experience. Depending on your specific application's implementation, you may need to expand upon or modify these components as needed.

## User Registration and Authentication

### Design
Explain the design of the user registration and authentication system, including user data storage and security measures.

### Security Considerations
Detail the security measures in place to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

## Sending and Receiving Messages

### Message Data Structure
Define the structure of messages, including metadata and content.

### Message Queues
Explain the use of message queues for asynchronous message delivery.

## Group Chat Functionality

### Group Management
Describe how groups are created, managed, and maintained.

### Group Messaging
Explain the architecture and functionality of group messaging.

## Real-Time Message Updates

### WebSockets Implementation
Detail the use of WebSockets for real-time message updates.

## Optional Features

### Video and Audio Calling
Describe the architecture and functionality of video and audio calling features.


## Application Type

### Web App (ReactJS)

## Backend Development using Nosql mongodb

### Programming Languages (Javascript and Node.js)

### Database Selection ( NoSQL)
1. Flexibility and Scalability
2. Real-Time Capabilities:
3. Horizontal Scalability:

### Data Models 

User Data Model:

Store user profiles as documents, including fields like username, email, display name, profile picture, and a list of friends or contacts.
Handle user authentication using a dedicated authentication service like OAuth or JWT tokens.
Message Data Model:

Each chat message can be stored as a document with attributes such as sender ID, recipient ID, message content, timestamp, and message type (text, image, etc.).
Use a collection or table for storing chat messages, where each document represents an individual message.
Group Chat Data Model (if applicable):

Create a document for each group chat that includes group members, chat messages, group name, and other relevant metadata.
Use subdocuments or arrays to store the messages within the group chat document.
Data Relationships:

Establish relationships between users, messages, and groups using references or embedding documents within each other, depending on the database's capabilities.

### Security - Authentication and Authorization:

Authentication:

Implement user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the chat application.
Use industry-standard authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0 or implement custom authentication logic.
Securely store user credentials by hashing and salting passwords.
Implement password reset mechanisms using email verification or OTPs for user account recovery.

Authorization:

Define roles and permissions for users to control access to various features within the application (e.g., regular user, administrator).
Implement middleware or access control checks on routes and functions to ensure users have the appropriate permissions.
Consider role-based access control (RBAC) to manage authorization more effectively.
